description= _ "When a Vendeeni comes of age it is compelled by custom to challenge a close friend in combat. Those that lose the fight are robbed of their status and forced into a life of drudgery, as a Drone. As well as providing a workforce, this custom is also maintained to ensure that personal friendships are severed early - in case they conflict with loyalty to the tribe."
